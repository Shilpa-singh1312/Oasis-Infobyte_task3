# Unemployment Analysis with Python
## Overview
Unemployment is a crucial economic indicator, reflecting the percentage of the labor force that is currently without work but actively seeking employment. This analysis aims to explore and understand the trends in unemployment rates, with a particular focus on the sharp increase observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Project Description
The goal of this project is to analyze unemployment trends using Python, leveraging various data analysis and visualization techniques to gain insights into the factors influencing unemployment rates. By examining historical data, particularly the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we can uncover patterns and trends that might inform future economic decisions.
